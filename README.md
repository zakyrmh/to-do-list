## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase account

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd modern-todo-list
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your apps
5. Add a web app and copy the configuration

### 4. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 5. Firestore Security Rules
Update your Firestore rules in the Firebase Console:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /todos/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true; // For development only
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### 7. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
```
